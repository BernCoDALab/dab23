And five years ago, a paper in the <em>SAA Archaeological Record</em> once again brought together many authors to endorse the concept of ‘Open Science in Archaeology’. In 2022, we can perhaps at last claim that open archaeology has come of age – if not as an established norm, then at least as a widely-accepted aspiration! So it seems timely to again take stock of which developments have proved fruitful over the past decade, and to ask which directions the field should take in the next. As guiding principles such as the <a href=https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>FAIR</a> and <a href=https://www.gida-global.org/care>CARE</a> increasingly establish themselves in the wider digital humanities in recent years, how should digital archaeology position itself?</p><p>We hope the colloquium will provoke debate on the status and role of &lsquo;open&rsquo; archaeological research with the spectrum of archaeological practice. We would also like to consider how, as digital archaeologists, we should position ourselves under the emerging umbrella of the digital humanities, and what we can learn from the paths taken there. The colloquium will be a forum for both junior and senior researchers from different fields to discuss and share their work and experiences.</p><h2 id=session-format>Session format</h2><p>The colloquium will consist of three main sessions dealing with the following topics:</p><ul><li>The impact and significance of open science in archaeology to date</li><li>The interaction between archaeology, open science and the digital humanities</li><li>Practical applications and exemplars for open science in archaeological research in the next decade</li></ul><p>All three sessions will feature presentations from <a href=/speakers>invited keynote speakers</a> and from an open <a href=/news/call_for_papers/>call for papers</a>.</p><h2 id=workshops--excursion>Workshops & excursion</h2><p>On the third day of the colloquium, participants will have the opportunity to join one of two workshops or an archaeological excursion to the shoreso of Lake Biel and lake Neuchâtel.</p><h4 id=workshop-1-research-data-management-and-open-data-in-archaeology>Workshop 1: Research data management and open data in archaeology</h4><p>In this workshop, the Open Science Team of the University Library of Bern introduces the basics of data management and the publication and re-use of research data.</p><p>Lecturer: Open-Science-Team UB Bern, to be announced</p><h4 id=workshop-2-writing-reproducible-research-with-r-and-rrtools>Workshop 2: Writing Reproducible Research with R and rrtools</h4><p>This practical workshop will provide the more advanced participants with a workflow how to use R and rrtools for making your analysis and publications reproducible.</p><p>Lecturer: Ben Marwick, Associate Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Washington</p><h4 id=excursion>Excursion</h4><p>On the third day of the colloquium, 3rd February 2023, participants will have the opportunity to join a field trip to the shores of Lake Biel and Lake Neuchâtel.</p><p>The first stop is planned at the bay of Sutz-Lattringen, Lake Biel, with its many Neolithic and Bronze Age pile dwellings. Since 2011, many of them belong to the UNESCO world heritage site &ldquo;Prehistoric Pile-dwellings around the Alps&rdquo;. We will also visit the dendro-laboratory and diving headquarter of Bern Canton.</p><p>The second stop will be the <a href=http://latenium.ch/en/>Laténium</a>, archaeological park and museum in Hauterive. The museum is located next tof Lake Neuchâtel on the former prehistoric lakeshore settlements of Hauterive - Champréveyres.</p><p>Preliminary schedule:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>09:00</td><td>Departure from Bern, venue location (Hallerstrasse 12, 3012 Bern)</td></tr><tr><td>10:00</td><td>Arrival in Sutz-Lattringen<br>Guided visit of the dendrolaboratory and diving headquarters</td></tr><tr><td>12:00</td><td>Departure from Sutz-Lattringen</td></tr><tr><td>12:45</td><td>Arrival in Hauterive, Laténium<br>Self-guided walk through the archaeological park</td></tr><tr><td>13:00</td><td>Lunch in Hauterive</td></tr><tr><td>14:15</td><td>Guided visit of the Laténium</td></tr><tr><td>16:15</td><td>Departure from Hauterive, Laténium</td></tr><tr><td>17:15</td><td>Arrival in Bern, venue location</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The participants have to organize snacks and lunch during the trip on their own.
