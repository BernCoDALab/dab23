the visualization of complex 3D geometry in interactive environments. One of the advantages of
these technologies is that they can make visual Archeological data widely accessible. However,
adapting XR in the educational context of Archaeology requires further research. In this
preliminary study, the potential of these technologies will be explored in the field of
Archaeozoology. Archaeozoologists study faunal remains recovered from archaeological sites to
analyze past animal-human relationships. Conventionally students learn how to identify faunal
remains by using bone atlases with 2D drawings and, if possible, physical reference collections.
However, not every university has access to such collections. In addition, access to these
collections is often restricted to a few people due to the limited space in the laboratories. For this
reason, many students have little to no opportunity to work with reference collections and
therefore rely on conventional 2D bone atlases. Visualizing 3D information from 2D images
requires strong spatial skills which can vary among people depending on their previous education,
gender, and hobbies. Thus, using only conventional atlases can make it difficult for students to
transition from 2D to working with actual archaeological faunal remains. Currently, there are a few
3D bone collections that aim to improve the accessibility of reference collections. However, these
libraries mostly made by universities from overseas do not apply to the faunal remains from
Central Europe. Furthermore, on these online databases, the one-on-one scale visualization as
well as the comparison of the 3D models with real-life objects is not possible. Additionally, these
libraries don’t offer training modules specifically designed for educational purposes. Instead of
online 3D model databases, MAR (Mobile Augmented Reality) could be used to address these
issues. Unlike VR (Virtual Reality), MAR doesn&rsquo;t require a headset and is therefore accessible for
every smartphone user independent of their location. Hence, this study presents a prototype of
OsteoAR, an educational bone atlas in MAR that will give students easy access to the reference
collections and help them visualize and interact with these models.</p></div></article></main><footer style=font-size:12px><a href=https://berncodalab.github.io/ title="Bern Computational and Digital Archaeology Lab" style="display:block;font:700 16px raleway,helveticaneue-light,Arial,sans-serif;text-transform:uppercase;text-decoration:none"><img src=/images/codalab_logo.png style="float:left;width:48px;height:48px;margin:-8px 8px 0 0">Bern<br>CoDA Lab</a><p>Website made with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com/jacksalici/salinger-theme>Salinger</a>.</p></footer></body><script src=/js/main.js></script>
