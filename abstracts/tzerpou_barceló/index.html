sites have been frequently implemented both for research and dissemination purposes
creating widely accessible and immersive content. However, certain concerns arise
related to theoretical considerations as well as to practical hazards in the creation of
models.</p><p>This poster will focus on the presentation and analysis of the theoretical
considerations regarding virtual reconstructions and visualization of prehistoric
archaeological sites. It will present existent critics of the use of virtual models,
structure a theoretical framework for their implementation, and propose an alternative
for the virtual models to be more dynamic and better designed for dissemination
purposes (e.g. in museum exhibitions). This poster will not examine a specific
prehistoric case study, but all the ideas elaborated below derive from reflections on
the study of prehistoric sites.</p><p>Delving deeper into the theoretical considerations it is evident that many of the
current critics to virtual models are actually critics to post-modernism; their core idea
is that the model -or simulacrum- actually precedes and determines the reality.
According to that, in the field of virtual archaeology the visualization(s) of the past
could end up being “invented”, minimizing the importance of the archaeological data.
This approach expresses a disagreement with the current post-processual
archaeological theory and the derived multiple readings of the past, especially as
applied in prehistory. Nowadays, this discussion still remains open.</p><p>On the other hand, critics have also been expressed about aspects related to the
process of creating and using a virtual model, such as: the quantity and quality of
information acquired prior to the reconstruction; the archive of data and the
accessibility to it; the guidelines for the creation of models; and the validation of
models and reconstructions. Moreover, special emphasis is put on the critics related to
the use of virtual models, since, in many cases, they do not achieve to overcome being
mere illustrations. Undoubtedly, the models contribute to transforming data into
information, but usually they are not dynamic, and neither they enhance knowledge
creation.</p><p>The creation of more plausible and visually friendly models was attempted during the
past years, in order to improve the final product and answer some of the criticisms
presented above. However, even if verisimilitude is an important factor to enhance
virtual models, we will present interactivity as a key element to achieve so. The model
is not only supposed to be part of the user’s activity, but to allow him to explore,
interact, and discover information, concepts and stimuli. Therefore, the process and
the different versions of a model should be displayed together with the final model,
transforming the user into an active participant in knowledge creation through the
interaction with them. Moreover, the preparation of open-access platforms/archives
where virtual models can be easily accessible is also an important aspect.</p><p>In conclusion, a solid theoretical and practical framework is necessary regarding
visualization theories, creation of digital models, and interactivity; that is how what
cannot be seen finally becomes visible.</p></div></article></main><footer style=font-size:12px><a href=https://berncodalab.github.io/ title="Bern Computational and Digital Archaeology Lab" style="display:block;font:700 16px raleway,helveticaneue-light,Arial,sans-serif;text-transform:uppercase;text-decoration:none"><img src=/images/codalab_logo.png style="float:left;width:48px;height:48px;margin:-8px 8px 0 0">Bern<br>CoDA Lab</a><p>Website made with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com/jacksalici/salinger-theme>Salinger</a>.</p></footer></body><script src=/js/main.js></script>
