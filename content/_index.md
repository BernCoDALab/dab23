# Advancing open research into the next decade

Following the success of the [inaugural 2019 colloquium](https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/services/events/conferences/past_conferences/digital_archaeology/announcement/index_eng.html), the second iteration of 'Digital Archaeology Bern' (DAB) will take place at the University of Bern on the 1st to 3rd February, 2023.

Ten years ago, a groundbreaking special issue of *World Archaeology* on 'Open Archaeology' introduced the concept to the wider discipline. And five years ago, a paper in the *SAA Archaeological Record* once again brought together many authors to endorse the concept of ‘Open Science in Archaeology’. In 2022, we can perhaps at last claim that open archaeology has come of age – if not as an established norm, then at least as a widely-accepted aspiration! So it seems timely to again take stock of which developments have proved fruitful over the past decade, and to ask which directions the field should take in the next. As guiding principles such as the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) increasingly establish themselves in the wider digital humanities in recent years, how should digital archaeology position itself?

We hope the colloquium will provoke debate on the status and role of 'open' archaeological research with the spectrum of archaeological practice. We would also like to consider how, as digital archaeologists, we should position ourselves under the emerging umbrella of the digital humanities, and what we can learn from the paths taken there. The colloquium will be a forum for both junior and senior researchers from different fields to discuss and share their work and experiences.
