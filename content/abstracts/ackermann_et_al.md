The *Swiss Inventory of Coin Finds* was founded in 1992 as a documentation centre that records and
documents numismatic sources from Switzerland and the Principality of Liechtenstein. With no
physical collection of its own, handling digital data was a requirement from the start.
The physical aspects of antique coins—a handmade, mass-produced, and precisely datable object—
are ideally suited to being described in a standard way. After an increasing interest in ancient
numismatics during the Renaissance, the Austrian numismatist Joseph Eckhel (1737–1798) detailed
for the first time the basic elements of coins like metals, denominations, legends, type descriptions,
etc. Afterwards, descriptions of coins were made in a standardised manner, with little change in
conventions since, and the amount of available data is growing steadily.

Numismatists embraced digital databases as soon as they were invented, digitising massive amounts
of index cards and lists. Naturally, the principles of early digital database design were based on
existing analogue data. Furthermore, the digital databases were confined to a single institution, and
their accessibility was not significantly improved over analogue data.

This held true even after the emergence of the internet. While an increasing number of institutions
made their data accessible online, their databases stayed disconnected and barred from information
exchange.

The important technological steppingstone was the advent of Web 3.0. The semantic web enabled
the creation of an interface between disconnected databases all over the world. The organisation
behind one of the interfaces, [nomisma.org](https://nomisma.org), is an international, collaborative project that consists of
experts in the fields of numismatics, computer science, and Semantic Web principles. Since 2010,
nomisma.org has been hosted and financially supported by the *American Numismatic Society* in New
York. The *Swiss Inventory of Coin Finds* participates in its scientific committee since 2017, helping to
establish international standards in numismatics.

In contrast to the participation in international endeavours, the databases of the SICF are not yet
part of the Linked Open Data Cloud. Structural, political, and technical limitations are a hindrance to
practical participation. Many obstacles have been overcome in recent years, and the road to joining
the nomisma.org network is nearing completion.
