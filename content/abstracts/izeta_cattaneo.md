Open science and open archaeology have been developing steadily on a global level. However, there are still regions in which development is incipient. Particularly in what was once called the third world and is geopolitically recognized as the global south. In particular, our experience in Latin America allows us to offer a general look at this interaction between open science and open archaeology. Also, relating it to the great activity that has existed for decades in Latin America to achieve greater openness towards the adoption of open science, as recently proposed by UNESCO. However, for the archaeology of this region, there is still a lack of activists fostering its adoption within professional practice.  Therefore, in this paper, we demonstrate the state of progress in implementing open science/open archaeology at a regional level, focusing on the Argentine Republic. In particular, to present the actions of what is now known as the Argentine Digital Archaeology Network (RadAr). This network has brought together 19 different institutions in the national territory interested in the various aspects that involve archaeological practice in a digital ecosystem and within an increasingly committed archaeological practice. In this framework, we present the questions and discussions that place us in the state-of-the-art in Latin America. Where the discussion of the digital data long-term preservation and shared use of data generated within archaeological projects of basic and applied research continues.  Advancing in the same questions asked in 2019 in the first digital archaeology symposium held in Córdoba (Argentina). Why is this important for the development of the discipline at a local and regional level? What is at stake when sharing and releasing data on open digital platforms in Latin America? What do researchers acquire or lose with this new practice within the framework of local South American science?
