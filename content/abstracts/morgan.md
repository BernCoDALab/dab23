Bringing together the massive datasets generated by archaeological research is important for interoperability and reproducibility, but also for creativity. In this talk I emphasise what has been characterised as the "R" in FAIR: re-use. My work to this point has been focussed partly in the re-use of archaeological data for both practical and radical remediation. This work introduces new questions and methodological directions for archaeological research and can be used for thought-provoking dissemination to various audiences. By using methodologies based on open science principles, we can bring together environmental data, zooarchaeological assemblages, evidence of trade and foodways, osteobiographies, architectural remains, and all other textual and material traces to engage what I characterise as archaeological worldbuilding.
