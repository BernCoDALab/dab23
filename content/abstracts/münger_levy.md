The paper presents ongoing research of the Swiss-Israeli project "Stamp-seals of the
Southern Levant – A Multi-faceted Prism for Studying Entangled Histories in an
Interdisciplinary Perspective", funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. In this
presentation, we focus on aspects of data visualization and analysis, following a digital
humanities approach.

The project's database comprises ca. 12,000 items unearthed in controlled excavations both
in Israel/Palestine and Jordan. It is based on Othmar Keel's pioneering work, whose printed
"Corpus of stamp-seal amulets" comprises ca. 7500 entries. This corpus has now been fully
digitized and is being complemented by the addition of the remaining ca. 5000 items by an
international team of scholars.

The implementation of the large collaborative database raised several practical and
methodological challenges related to topics such as taxonomy, chronology, clustering or
spatial distribution. We addressed these challenges by developing digital tools, which will be
show-cased in the presentation.
