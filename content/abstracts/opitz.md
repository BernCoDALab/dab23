The introduction of new policies and incentives intended to address the climate crisis, environmental sustainability and food security are prompting significant changes in how land is used, leading to extensive transformations of rural landscapes in the UK, Europe and globally. This paper uses a series of case studies to discuss how archaeological remote and near surface sensing is reorienting itself to contribute to understanding, managing, and encouraging critical community engagement with this process of change. These case studies are drawn from ongoing work by the [Interoperable Precision Agricultural and Archaeological Sensing Technologies â€“ Critical Zone Observation (ipaast-czo) Project](https://ipaast-czo.glasgow.ac.uk/) to develop data collection and analytical methods which are interoperable across precision agricultural, environmental and archaeological applications and from lidar-led archaeological studies of forested landscapes. Drawing together the case studies it identifies opportunities and barriers to collaboration and outlines a framework to create positive engagements between archaeology, heritage management and agro-environment domains by improving technical and semantic interoperability of their sensing data.
