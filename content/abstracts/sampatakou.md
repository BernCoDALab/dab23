Archaeologists are keen to try digital media and cutting-edge technology to study the
past or to present their research to the wider public. Digital archaeology is an
established field of archaeology usually focused on using digital technology to study or
communicate the past. Interactivity and immersion along with archaeological
storytelling are often used to create digital heritage experiences, such as Virtual Reality
(VR) installations, to communicate archaeological research to the public and to attract
more visitors to the museums and cultural institutions. However, the suitability,
limitations, and results of these techniques have not been widely assessed and
discussed, neither has the overall relationship between digital archaeology and public
engagement.

In this poster I will present my current doctoral research, where I am looking into
different media and techniques of communicating archaeological research. The aim of
my research is to assess the impact and implications of the use of different forms of
archaeological storytelling in communicating archaeological research to the wider
public. In addition, I am examining whether and to what degree can an archaeologist
employ such digital tools to communicate their research without hiring professionals,
undergoing long training, or using extra funds. Finally, I want to assess which digital
tools would offer the best options for archaeologists to develop such heritage
experience. For this reason, I have looked into two widely used digital media:
videogames and VR.

In order to study the impact of the stories and to assess whether and in what degree
the research questions were covered, I have created an experiment as an assessing
methodology which combines qualitative and qualitative research tools; The
experiment made use of groups of individuals across three different countries: the UK,
Malta, and Greece. The design of the experiment is focused on assessing any previous
knowledge on the subject via pre-questionnaires, as well as the knowledge obtained
after the experience via post-questionnaires. The quantitative data from the
questionnaires were processed using Qualtrics and analysed using Excel. Moreover,
qualitative data have also been collected during follow up interviews with the
individuals, which will also be analysed and studied using Thematic and Discourse
Analyses. Hence, the final datasets are a combination of quantitative and qualitative
data aiming to help to better understand the impact of the stories as well as to answer
the research questions.
