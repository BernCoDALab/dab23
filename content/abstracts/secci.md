Funded by the Honor Frost Foundation (HFF), the Mare Cyprium Project is a digital archaeology
public outreach exercise. It integrates data produced by the Maritime Archaeological Research
Laboratory (MARELab), University of Cyprus (UCY) into a series of digital multimedia applications
(DMAs). The main aim is to promote the value and complexity of Cypriot maritime cultural heritage.
The project will focus on diverse case studies attempting to reach a diversified public. The case
studies include artefacts, shipwrecks, harbours, and traditional boats. The DMAs are: i) a 3D
animation of wreck site formation processes; ii) a 2D animated storytelling of an artefactâ€™s biography;
iii) Interactive timeline on the history of two Cypriot harbours; iv) a 3D glossary of shipbuilding
terms; and v) a 3D collection of traditional boats. This paper will critically discuss the general project
idea and rationale, the DMAs concepts and scenarios, and the results of their preliminary
development.
