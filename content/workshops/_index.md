## Excursion

On the third day of the colloquium, 3rd February 2023, participants had the opportunity to join a field trip to the shores of Lake Biel and Lake Neuchâtel.

The first stop was at the bay of Sutz-Lattringen, Lake Biel, with its many Neolithic and Bronze Age pile dwellings. Since 2011, many of them belong to the UNESCO world heritage site "Prehistoric Pile-dwellings around the Alps".  We also visited the dendro-laboratory and diving headquarter of Bern Canton.

The second stop was [Laténium](http://latenium.ch/en/), an archaeological park and museum in Hauterive. The museum is located next to Lake Neuchâtel on the former prehistoric lakeshore settlements of Hauterive–Champréveyres.
