## Excursion

On the third day of the colloquium, 3rd February 2023, participants will have the opportunity to join a field trip to the shores of Lake Biel and Lake Neuchâtel.

The first stop is planned at the bay of Sutz-Lattringen, Lake Biel, with its many Neolithic and Bronze Age pile dwellings. Since 2011, many of them belong to the UNESCO world heritage site "Prehistoric Pile-dwellings around the Alps".  We will also visit the dendro-laboratory and diving headquarter of Bern Canton.

The second stop will be the [Laténium](http://latenium.ch/en/), archaeological park and museum in Hauterive. The museum is located next to Lake Neuchâtel on the former prehistoric lakeshore settlements of Hauterive–Champréveyres.
